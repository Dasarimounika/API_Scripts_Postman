The root-endpoint for which we make the API call is “http://api.planefinder.net/api/airport/times/UME”

I have divided the test suite into two scenarios       
1.Test cases
2.Failed test case

Along with this I have saved the response body in json format(Response.json)

Note - I have globally declared a variable (jsonData) which parses through the json data in response
